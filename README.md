# Out of Office Avatar

Someday this repo will be a cool app that you can use to just upload your avatar, select a banner to use, and save the resulting avatar with banner. Today, it's just a collection of a few banner assets I have used to manually do this for myself.

If you are comfortable with Photoshop, you can open the PSD file, File > Place your existing avatar beyind one of the layers you wish to use, and File > Save a copy as a .jpg or .png image to use on GitHub and elsewhere that you want to notify your fellow internet colleagues that you'll not be seeing their pings and pongs for some time.

If you are not comfortable with Photoshop, just download one of the .PNG overlays, you can use a [tool like this one](https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/combine-two-images-into-one.php) to just upload the overlay banner you wish to use and your own avatar and it will spit out a new one for you. :sparkles:
 
 Take time away from your machine. Be healthy. Live life. :heart: :v: :sunglasses:
